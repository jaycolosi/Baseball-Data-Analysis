# Physical Attributes and Baseball Hitting Statistics 

Data Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/baseball-databank

The Baseball Databank is a compilation of historical baseball data on baseball players, teams, and games from 1871 to 2015. For this project I will only be using the *Master.csv*: which includes all physical attributes of players such as height and swing direction, and the *Hitting.csv*: which includes all hitting statistics by year. For this analysis, I will be exploring if the physical attributes of a baseball player have any effect on that player's hitting statistics. 

The data analysis is contain inside the *"JColosi_BaseballProject_Analysis.ipynb"* Jupyter Notebook. 
A data dictonary be accessed in the files.
